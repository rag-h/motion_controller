# Skid Steer Robot Autonomous Navigation 
This repository contains a  work in progress Robot Operating System (ROS) implementation of an OffWorld Robotics skid-steer robot model for competition with the ROS navigation stack.
The model has functionality to use the Adaptive Monte Carlo Localisation (AMCL) method for localisation with the Elastic band planner method to navigate to goal locations. However, the AMCL with the move_base ros package is quite unreliable due to current configureations and as such the gmapping slam package with move_base is recommended and used here. Launch files for both methods can be found here.

## Prerequisites

1. [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) OS or [debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)

2. Robot Operating System (ROS). Installation instructions can be found [here](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation). Make sureyou install melodic.

3. Install ROS nodes required for the local and global planners, amcl, maps and motor control for the navigation stack.

```sh
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-move-base
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-map-server
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-amcl
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-eband-local-planner
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-global-planner
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-teb-local-planner 
$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-moveit
$ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-slam-gmapping
```

## Installing

Clone this repository in your catkin workspace 'src/' folder.

```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone --branch T210_Motion_Control_RHariharan https://github.com/Offworld-Robotics/bandicoot_software.git
```

Build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

If you haven’t already, the following line can be added to your .bashrc to auto-source all new terminals
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

## Run the Code
You will first launch the world, then spawn the robot inside the world, then you will start the autonomous navigation code.

To launch the world, in a terminal window, type the following
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ roslaunch skid_steer_robot world.launch
```
This will have launched the world inside the skid_steer_robot package.
To launch a world from the provided default gazebo_ros package you can launch another world using any of the following:
```sh
$ roslaunch gazebo_ros willowgarage_world.launch
$ roslaunch gazebo_ros mud_world.launch
$ roslaunch gazebo_ros shapes_world.launch
$ roslaunch gazebo_ros rubble_world.launch
```

In a new terminal, spawn the robot using the 'spawn.launch' file.
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch skid_steer_robot spawn.launch
```
Your robot should now have sucessfully spawned inside the world.

In a new terminal, start the autonmous navigation code using the 'navigation.launch' file.
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch skid_steer_robot navigation.launch
```
This should have now started pre-configured RVIZ window

### Testing on RVIZ

1. In Rviz, click on the 2D Nav Goal in the top menu. 
2. Click on the Rviz map where you want the robot to navigate too. 

### Testing using bash
In a new terminal, run a program to send a goal position to the robot.
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ rosrun skid_steer_robot goal
```
In the src/simple_motion_controller.cpp file line 82, you will be able to modify the goal position and change the frame etc.

## Additional: 
### How to point and click on rviz map and output the position
1. Open a new terminal and type:
```sh
 rostopic echo /clicked_point
```
2. Open Rviz and use Publish a point tool.
3. Click anywhere on the map.
4. The result should be instantaneously displayed in the terminal where we have echoed /clicked_point

### Getting Started on Learning the Theory
Go through the following resources in order and you will understand the basics behind how everything works. A detailed pdf report outlining everything is currently in the works. All of these resources will take a week or two to get through. The first two youtube links are very hands on, and are very highly recommended!
