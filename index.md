## Welcome to Raghav's motion_controller Github!
The aim of this github project website is to help people understand the theory behind the ros navigation stack as well well as to help them build an autonomous skid_steer robot from scratch as well! I hope everyone finds this useful to them! 

Before we start, I highly encourage everyone to have a look at the following Youtube tutorials by the [The Construct](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt6Lag-vv25fTX3e11mVY1Q), as those were the videos I initially watched to gain an understanding of most of my understanding about the ros packages and how to use them!
1. [Exploring ROS using a 2 wheeled Robot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK0b4e05LnzY2I4sXWTOA4_82cMh6tL-5)
2. [ROS Navigation in 5 days](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiiw0aSVHcAkF26qR6Q7x6RlLAL6-vuF3) 

My tutorials will try to go through the following:
1. Spawning a robot in Gazebo and moving it around with a keyboard
2. Loading in a world and mapping it using the gmapping package
3. Setting up the Navigation stack and move_base
